# ecobici-bikeshare
This project will join together multiple data sets (including air quality, weather, built environment, etc) to combine with bikeshare ridership to assess how the system responds to different conditions. Additionally, the data will be combined with variables reflecting changes in a local driving restriction policy to assess how the system responds to increased restrictions.
